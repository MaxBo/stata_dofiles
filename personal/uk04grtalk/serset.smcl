{p 4 4 4}{it}
The underlying data for plots in Stata's graphics are stored in {cmd:serset}s
and these data can be accessed using the {cmd:serset} command, see 
help {help serset}.

{p 4 4 4}{it}
We can see a directory of all of the sersets underlying all of the graphs in
memory (we currently have two graphs), using {cmd:serset dir}.  (Click the
command below).{sf}

{p 0 4 0}. {stata serset dir}

{p 4 4 4}{it}
Looking in the command window we see that we have two sersets, numbers 0 and
1, and that both sersets have 955 observations with the 0th serset
containing variables {cmd:heatdd} and {cmd:tempjan} and the 1st serset
containing variables {cmd:cooldd} and {cmd:tempjuly}. {sf}

{p 4 4 4}{it}
Let's use the {cmd:serset set} command to make the 0th serset current, then
use the {cmd:serset use} command to use the data from the serset and make it
our current dataset.{sf}

{p 0 4 0}. {stata serset set 0}

{p 0 4 0}. {stata serset use , clear}

{p 4 4 4}{it}
If we now list our data, we see that our dataset is now the data used to
create the {cmd:heattdd} vs. {cmd:tempjan} plot.{sf}

{p 0 4 0}. {stata list}

{p 4 4 4}{it}
We can do the same for the 1st serset, the one that holds the data for the
{cmd:cooldd} vs. {cmd:tempjuly} plot.{sf}

{p 0 4 0}. {stata serset set 1}{p_end}
{p 0 4 0}. {stata serset use , clear}{p_end}
{p 0 4 0}. {stata list}{p_end}
